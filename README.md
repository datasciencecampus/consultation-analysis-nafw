# Background of this work ?

Data Science techniques were used to analyse responses to the National Assembly for 
Wales Children,Young People and Education Committee’s consultation on the Children (Abolition 
of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill (“the Bill”) - introduced by Julie 
Morgan AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services. The Assembly’s Business Committee
had remitted the Bill to the Children, Young People and Education Committee.


The Welsh Government’s stated purpose for the Bill is to abolish the common law defence
of reasonable punishment so it is no longer available in Wales to parents or those acting
in loco parentis as a defence to assault or battery against a child. The Welsh Government
states that the Bill is intended to support children’s rights by prohibiting the use of
physical punishment, through removal of this defence.
